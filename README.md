# PummelParty-MonoInjection
This is a hack I developed for a game I play with my friends.<br>
I created this as a sort of prank and it was hilarious.

It works by compiling the code into a .dll that can be injected into the game.<br>
This process is called mono-injection, a method of hacking spefically used in unity engine games.<br>
It works by creating your own game object and tricking the game into running commands through that object.
